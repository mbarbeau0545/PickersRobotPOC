After identifier, CAN 2.0 and CAN-FD have a different action:
• CAN 2.0 sends an RTR bit to precise the type of frame: data frame (RTR is dominant) or remote frame
(RTR is recessive).
• CAN-FD sends always a dominant RRS (reserved) as it only supports data frames.

The features of the FDCAN on STM32 devices are listed below:
• Compliant with CAN protocol version 2.0 part A, B and ISO 11898-1: 2015, -4
• Accessible 10-Kbyte RAM memory to allocate up to 2560 words
• Improved acceptance filtering
• Two configurable receive FIFOs
• Up to 64 dedicated receive buffers
• Separate signaling on reception of high priority messages
• Up to 32 dedicated transmit buffers
• Configurable transmit FIFO and transmit queue
• Configurable transmit event FIFO
• Clock calibration unit
• Transceiver delay compensation

------------------Rx CAN------------------
Possède 2 Rx FIFO -> up to 64 Element each, their position in the RAM are automatically and dynamically managed overwrite possibles
Rx buffer dedicate -> 64 buffer of one element, user choose the buffer index , option to overwrite or not, user choose the buffer index 

------------------Tx CAN------------------
Can provide information about a transmission of message CAN on the CAN bus, store ID and timestamp 
can send msg can from 
           - 32 element Tx buffer 
    and/or - 1 Tx queue (First to send = High  Priority)
    or     - 1 Tx FIFO (first in fisrst out with index)
