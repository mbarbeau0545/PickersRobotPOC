# STM32 Template Project 
This project purpose is to offers a framework/interface that works with any stm32 due to hardware configuration.
The main idea of this project is no matter the MCU used the logic will always works because it is not directly related to a hardware MPU
## Summary 
- [Get Started](#Get Started)
- Annexe 1, Hardware Configuration tutorial
- Annexe 2, Software Configuration tutorial

## Get Started
- First, install all dependencies needed :
    - Visual Studio Code
    - On Visual Studio Code, install Platform.io
    - On platflorm.io install the framework of stm32 "ST STM32" on the tab PIO Home/Platforms
- The, clone the branch Dev on your local disk
- Go in file platform.ini and choose the right nucleo board, the one you're using. To do so, all the board managed by platform io are in PIO Home/Board, find your nucleo or the MCU name, that will generate some code
- Look the documention on Doc/InfoPrj for more documentation on this project/ Each module has a documentation, for th doxygen documetation see the file "index.html"
- Once it is done, you have to configure the Excel in Doc/ConfigPrj/ExcelCfg/Hardware_Configuration, see in Annexe 1 how to do so.
- Do the same for the Software_Configuration, Annexe 2. (not a restriction if user just want to test signal)
- For generate the code, go to Doc/ConfigPrj/PythonTool and launch the main.py file.
- Now you can Build/Flash you're project using platform.io framework
- go to the part "include" of src\1_FMK\FMK_CFG\FMKCFG_ConfigFiles\FMKCPU_ConfigPublic.h and change the include concern the stm32fYYXX accordinly yours 
- Put your code in the file APP_LGC.c, in function APPLGC_Init to run once and APPLGC_Cyclic to run cyclically


## Annexe 1
- Take te datasheet of your stm32 microcontr√¥ler
- Open the Hardware_Configuration file
- Go to the General Info sheet
- Put the hardware configuration as ask by the arrays on this sheet, the first array, you just have to copied/pasted the enum IRQn_Type in file stm32fXXYY
- For timer/adc/dac/dma etc put the right infomation and keep it as so for example for timers it's 'timer' + '_' + 'number'
- Go to the sheet FMKIO and filled all tables as asking, for PWM purpose be careful on which timer you choose, some of them are not meant to make pwm signal
- Go to the sheet CPU and inform the timer used for event timers whhich means periodic timer
- Save and Generate code from Doc/ConfigPrj/PythonToolmain.py file.
